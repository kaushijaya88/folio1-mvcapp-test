Steps to run the app

Used technologies and tools
1. Sql server
2. Visual studio 2017
3. Dapper ORM integration
4. Repository pattern
5. Jquery
6. Didn't use Web APi, .net core 2.1 version.

Notes
1. Not only in adding student but also considered the lastname duplication when updating the last name as well.
